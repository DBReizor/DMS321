    <h2> A timeless invention</h2>

    <h3> Overview </h3>
    <h4> A Pulley is a wheel and rope system that is used to gain 
        mechanical advantage when moving weights.  </h4>  

    <h3> Use over time </h3>
    <p>The earliest recorded usage of a Pulley dates back to ~1900-1800 
        BC in Ancient Egypt, where it was used to move heavy material. 
        In 300BC, Archimedes used compound pulleys 
        and the block-and-tackle system to pull a boat onto 
        land. Over time, the pulley system has been improved to make the 
        most out of mechanical advantage </p>

            The pulley enhances human ability to lift and move heavy 
            objects by reducing the effort required. It amplifies mechanical 
            advantage, allowing individuals or small teams to achieve feats 
            of lifting that would otherwise require far greater strength or 
            more people.

            Obselescence
        </h4>
        <p>
            The pulley makes obsolete or reduces reliance on direct brute 
            force and primitive methods of lifting, such as manually lifting 
            heavy loads or relying solely on levers and ramps. It shifts labor 
            from strength-intensive tasks to skill-based tasks.

    <!-- Retrieval -->
    <!-- What earlier obsolesced tool is brought back into play and 
     becomes an essential part of the new tool-->

    <div class = "InfoColumn">
        <h4 class = "ColumnTitle">
            Retrieval
        </h4>
        <p>
            The pulley retrieves ancient principles of mechanical ingenuity 
            and problem-solving. It brings back the ingenuity of using simple
            machines (like levers and inclined planes) that transform how
            humans interact with physical forces.
        </p>
    </div>
    <!-- Reversal -->
    <!-- When carried to full potential, the new tool will reverse its original characteristics. What would be the potential reversal of the new tool -->

    <div class = "InfoColumn">
        <h4 class = "ColumnTitle">
            Reversal
        </h4>
        <p>
            When overused or excessively relied upon, the pulley system may 
            reverse into mechanical dependency or inefficiency, especially if 
            the systems become overly complex or poorly maintained. For instance, 
            modern systems like cranes (which integrate pulleys) can fail 
            catastrophically without proper oversight, emphasizing a need 
            for constant maintenance and human oversight.
